=== Todo === 
* restd.net - svc - Update POST, PUT & DELETE to new result style (200 response returns full object even after delete)
* restd.net - svc - Describe how to handle _restd properties sent as data to POST and PUT requests; remove them from the input or return a bad status
* svc - asp - Ensure that no _restd properties enter the restd file
* restd.net - svc - Add section on security
* restd.net - svc - Add section on sending application/x-www-form-urlencoded data instead of json
* restd.net - svc - Add: empty query argument should act as no query, i.e., get all
* svc - asp - Handle -1 blockSize restd files
* tools - arrestdX - Write tool design
* svc - asp - Allow spaces between the header properties & values when parsing
* svc - asp - Allow service to modify resource name before action processing?
* svc - asp - Allow the resource name to differ from the restd file name?
* svc - asp - Allow service to process resource name before action processing, e.g., create a new resource if desired
* svc - asp - Lock the file for writing as well as (or instead of) the .NET process
* svc - asp - Block the process until the file is unlocked during POST,PUT & DELETE
* svc - asp - ORestd - Verify that stash characters in strings don't mess up writing JSON to output
* svc - asp - ORestd - Verify that stash characters in $filters don't mess up writing JSON to output

===notes===
I found some old notes. I should look through them at some point & add things to the to do list.

Spray data if no filter
Support associations via _deferred in row
Support expand directive 
Base class named Restd 
Most functionality in Rest
If you don't put a resource, default to /
Odata mentions server-specific functions, may be how I add spatial queries
Check out what $metadata&$format=json looks like
Potentially add an __id property
The type should be EndpointName.ResourceName
Don't save if larger than block size

===more notes===
Tools
wellrestd [restd file]
Default: report
  Valid json?
  Valid restd?
  Current header info
  Number of records
/blockSize: change blockSize
  Number or 'tucked' or 'fluffed [size]'
  Fluffed will take longest record, add fluff value & pad to file system boundary
-vaccuum

restdman
  Edits & queries restd files
/get: get all
/get index: item
/query query: query
/post json
/put index json
/delete index
